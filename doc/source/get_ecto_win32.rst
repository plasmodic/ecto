path
=====
Windows needs some path setup for this to go smoothly.

::

set PATH=C:\Program Files\CMake 2.8\bin;C:\Python26\;C:\gtest\lib_dir

Also it may be useful to always work from the **Visual Studio Command Prompt** or otherwise
be sure to source the ``C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat`` before
starting any work.
