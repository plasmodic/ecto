.. index:: scheduler, Singlethreaded, Threadpool

schedulers
==========

The schedulers operate on the plasm.  There are singlethreaded and
threadpool schedulers.  Yes, the name *scheduler* is a little dry, and
some think a plasm should have a *metabolism* or *Krebs Cycle*
instead, but there were no motivating name collisions (as with
'node').

All schedulers should implement a basic interface for construction and
execution (the same as the interface as the Singlethreaded scheduler
implements); scheduler-specific functions and parameters may exist
outside this set.

Singlethreaded
--------------

.. class:: ecto.schedulers.Singlethreaded

   Singlethreaded scheduler.  This class will execute the cells in the
   plasm in topological order in a single thread.

   .. method:: __init__(plasm)

      Construct one around a plasm

   .. method:: execute()

      Execute the graph in an infinite loop.  Blocks.

   .. method:: execute(niter)

      Execute the graph niter times.  This call will blocks until the
      execution is finished.

   .. method:: execute_async()
   .. method:: execute_async(niter)

      These functions are the same as the blocking ones above, except
      they start an execution thread in the background and return
      immediately.

   .. method:: running()

      Returns true if the execution started by execute_async() is still running.

   .. method:: stop()

      Stops the background graph execution at the end of the current process() call.

   .. method:: wait()

      Blocks until the execution started by the last call to
      execute_async() is finished.

                  
Threadpool
----------

.. class:: ecto.schedulers.Threadpool

   Simple locally-greedy threadpool scheduler.  Each cell gets a
   thread that waits until its inputs are ready, then it requests that
   its ``process()`` method be run by one of a pool of worker threads.

   .. method:: __init__(plasm)

      Construct one around a plasm

   .. method:: execute()

      Execute the graph in an infinite loop.  Blocks.

   .. method:: execute(niter)

      Execute the graph niter times, with nthreads equal to the lesser
      of the hardware concurrency or the number of nodes in the graph.
      This call will blocks until the execution is finished.

   .. method:: execute(niter, nthreads)

      Execute the graph niter times in nthreads.  This call will
      blocks until the execution is finished.

   .. method:: execute_async()
   .. method:: execute_async(niter)
   .. method:: execute_async(niter, nthreads)

      These functions are the same as the synchronous ones above,
      except they start a background thread and return immediately.

   .. method:: running()

      Returns true if the execution started by execute_async() is still running.

   .. method:: stop()

      Stops the background graph execution at the end of the current process() call.

   .. method:: wait()

      Blocks until the execution started by the last call to
      execute_async() is finished.
